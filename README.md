# GelMA_pumps
This code is used to programmatically drain a couple of GelMA synthesis tanks.

The user must enter on the LCD screen the volume of water in the main tank and the time (days, hours, minutes and seconds) at which the system will start pumping. Once the countdown has finished, two pumps are activated simultaneously as long as it takes to empty the entered volume minus a small remainder to prevent the pump from running empty. 

Inputs are entered via a matrix keypad. In addition, the system has a level sensor to prevent the pump from running empty.
